[View the live project here.](https://richardbyrne95.github.io/CI-MS1-RBP-Website/index.html)

This is the main marketing website for Richard Byrne Productions. RBP is a recording, mixing and mastering studio located in Temple Bar, the heart of Dublin's music scene. This website is intended to display the services that RBP offers to artists in the music industry, and establish an online presence so that potential clients can find and consider RBP as a competitor in the market.

The website is designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for potential clients.

## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User Stories

    -   #### First Time Visitor Goals

        1. As a first time visitor, I want to understand the main purpose of the site and learn about the services provided by the business.
        2. As a first time visitor, I want to find testimonials from established artists in order to establish the authority of the business/brand.
        3. As a first time visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate through the site to find the content that fits my needs.

    -   #### Returning Visitor Goals
        
        1. As a returning visitor, I want to find ways of contacting the business.
        2. As a returning visitor, I want to find links to the social media of the business.

-   ### Design

-   A clean and minimal aethsthetic was the main design goal of this project. This was achieved through minimal and bold use of colours, liberal use of whitespace and the primary background colour being white.

    -   #### Colour Scheme

        -   The colour scheme of RBP is orange (#FF8400), white (#FFF), red (#C41230), and black (#000).

    -   #### Typography

        -   The primary font used throughout the site is Proxima Nova, with Sans-Serif as the fallback font. This font serves the goal of being minimal with no frills or ornamentation. However, Montserrat and Josefin-Sans are used for the headings of each page, both, again, with a fallback of Sans-Serif. All of these fonts are very easily readable, adding to the accessibility of the site.

    -   #### Imagery

        -   Despite the site having a minimalist feel, the imagery is very important to the user expierence. It is designed to both inform the visitor of what they can expect when recording and give them a deeper understanding of the brand. The large hero image was chosen to be such, so as to grab the user's attention, as well as to put the brand experience at the forefront of the visitor's attention.

## Features

-   Responsive elements on all device sizes
-   Responsive and adaptable navigation on all device sizes
-   Interactive elements


## Accessibility

-   Images: Most images on the site are placed using CSS, as opposed to the "img" element. Therefore, a relevant 'aria-label' was given to each image (apart from those that were deemed to be illegal by the W3 HTML validator) to provide content to screen readers etc.

-   Links:  All text links, including navigation, were given a role of 'button' to improve accessibility.

-   Tags:   Semantic element tags were used in order to improve accessibility, and reduce the footprint of the code.
